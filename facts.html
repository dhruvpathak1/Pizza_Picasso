                                California to build this record-setting pizza that stretched more than 6,333 feet in
                                length
                                and involved 17,700 pounds
                                of dough, 5,000 pounds of tomato sauce and 3,900 pounds of mozzarella cheese. According

                                LA Weekly, it was ultimately
                                sliced into 63,000 servings, most of which were donated to local homeless shelters.</p>

                                Cup, because on that

                                that it had to be baked in
                                5,234 separate batches over the course of two days).</p>

                                carefully added in 2.6 gram portions, because the crust was only slightly larger than a
