        <p>Mmmm…do you smell that? Fresh out of the oven, a steaming pie sits waiting to be eaten. Your senses are
            overtaken by the
            aroma of hot bread, melted cheese, and simmering tomato sauce. Are you ready to dig into that favorite of
            all foods?
            What are we talking about?<strong>Pizza, of course!</strong> Some kids like meat, and others don’t. Some
            kids like vegetables, and others try not to eat them. Some kids love
            seafood, while others think fish should stay in the sea. But one thing most kids can agree on is this: Pizza
            is awesome!

            Where did this much-loved food come from? We often associate pizza with Italian food. But do the Italians
            get the
            credit? Or did someone else make the very first pizza? There’s not an easy answer. Different historians have
            different
            ideas. A lot depends on how you define “pizza.”

            Do you think of pizza as a flatbread cooked in an oven? If so, its roots go back to ancient times in the
            Middle East.
            The ancient Babylonians, Israelites, and Egyptians all ate flat bread baked in mud ovens. Do you think a
            pizza has to have toppings? In that case, it dates back to the ancient Greeks and Romans. They both ate
            baked flatbreads topped with olive oil and spices. Today, we call this dish focaccia bread.

            What about the pizza most are familiar with? You know, the kind with tomato sauce, cheese, and toppings?
            That did start
            in Italy. Specifically, baker Raffaele Esposito from Naples is often given credit for making the first such
            pizza pie.
            Historians note, however, that street vendors in Naples sold flatbreads with toppings for many years before
            then.

            Legend has it that Italian King Umberto I and Queen Margherita visited Naples in 1889. There, Esposito was
            asked to make
            them a pizza. He topped the pizza with fresh tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, and basil. That pizza is still
            known as Pizza
            Margherita today.

            <strong>Italian immigrants brought pizza with them to Spain, France, England, and the United States. It
                didn’t gain popularity
                until after World War II, though. That’s when returning soldiers looked for the food they had grown to
                love while
                fighting overseas.</strong></p>
