            <h2>About Us</h2>
            If we are talking about the places in the world to have the best Pizza, then the best way to begin is with
            the
            land of
            Pizza. Naples, a city in southern Italy, is famous all around the globe for its pizzas, pizzas, and some
            more
            pizzas.
            The city is the home of the pie itself, and choosing the best pizzeria in town is one of the most arduous
            jobs.
            But
            Pizzeria Gino Sorbillo, on the old historic street of Via dei Tribunali, has bagged some of the most
            prominent
            awards in
            the industry. <span>No lines can justify how delicious Gino Sorbillo’s pizzas are! Just, arrive here early
                or be
                ready
                for one
                of the longest food queues to have the world’s best pizzas! </span>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            In the happy trattoria in the city centre, you can taste pizzas made with biological flours, without rising
            agents nor
            agents to make them softer. Some doughs are made only with 0 type flour, some others with a mix between 0
            type
            flour and
            whole-wheat flour combined with starter. Never be missing are some Italian famous excellence, like the San
            Marzano D.o.p
            tomato, the little yellow tomato cultivated on the slopes of the Somma – Vesuvio complex and the small
            tomatoes
            from the
            piennolo of Casa Barone D.o.p. The dairy products rigorously come from the low Italian boot, where Gino in
            person went
            to find the best producers for his pizzas.

            In the Antica Margherita, we found the fiordilatte mixed with buffalo milk “Il Casolare”, in the Margherita
            Bufala DOP,
            the buffalo milk mozzarella Dop from the Cooperativa “Le Tre Terre di Don Pepe Diana” and the Parmesan
            cheese
            Malandrone
            1477, in the Margherita dedicated a Bottura, the Conciato Romano, the most ancient cheese in Italy. The
            pizza is
            cooked
            in a wood-burning oven and…get ready for a humongous portion! For those usually worried by the heaviness of
            the
            Neapolitan dough, I assure you that in this case you will have a super thin pizza, not pressed crunchy, but
            soft, in
            certain points more coloured on the crust. You can see a thriving pizza, with perfumes intense and genuine
            from
            our
            Country.
